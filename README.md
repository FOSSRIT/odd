One Dimensional Display

This project ultimately aims to be a line of individually controllable RGB LEDs that is powered by a computer, that can act as lighting, display music visualizations, and respond to internet-based events. This will be done by having a C program running on a linux computer calculate what colors the leds should be, and then write the information out over serial to an arduino that will control daisy-chained TLC5940s to have fine control over each LED.
